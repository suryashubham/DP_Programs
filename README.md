# DP_Programs
Repository for programs of Dynamic programming.
We'll be learning from very basics and gradually
approach tuffer problems based on DP.

Dynamic Programming
---------------------
DP is nothing but recursion along with memoization i.e.
In simpler word we can say that we will be storing the
calculated results in some DS and In case we encounter
the same sub-problem, we'll not be calculating it
rather we'll be taking it's value from storage(DS where
we've stored the calculated values.)
